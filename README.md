This repository contains my solutions to the programming 
puzzles contained in the
[advent of code calendar](https://adventofcode.com).

Most likely the majority of this code will written in python because it
gets you started the quickest, but it is in no way a rule I set up for myself.
If I feel another programming language would be more appropriate or fun, I will
use that one.
